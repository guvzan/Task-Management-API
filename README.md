# Task Management API

A lightweight and secure RESTful API for managing tasks, built without frameworks for full control over the implementation.

## Features
âœ… CRUD operations for tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete).  
âœ… Each task contains:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Status ("Pending", "Completed", etc.)
   - Due date  
âœ… Filtering tasks by status or due date.  
âœ… **No framework used** â€“ built with pure Node.js for maximum flexibility.  
âœ… JWT-based authentication (token returned in response headers and cookies).  
âœ… Role-based access control ('user', 'admin').  
âœ… Users can only manage their own tasks.
